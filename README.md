# WEB103 Project 3 - CubeMap

Submitted by: **MITHUN V GOWDA**

About this web app: **CubeMap is a virtual community space for Rubik's cube enthusiasts. Pick a region of the world on an interactive cube to discover speedcubing competitions, meetups, and workshops happening there.**

Time spent: **2** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->

- [ ] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [ ] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
  - [ ]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [ ]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
- [ ] **The web app displays a title.**
- [ ] **Website includes a visual interface that allows users to select a location they would like to view.**
  - [ ] *Note: A non-visual list of links to different locations is insufficient.* 
- [ ] **Each location has a detail page with its own unique URL.**
- [ ] **Clicking on a location navigates to its corresponding detail page and displays list of all events from the `events` table associated with that location.**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] An additional page shows all possible events
  - [ ] Users can sort *or* filter events by location.
- [ ] Events display a countdown showing the time remaining before that event
  - [ ] Events appear with different formatting when the event has passed (ex. negative time, indication the event has passed, crossed out, etc.).

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Personal Stretch Features (Planned)

Ideas I want to build beyond the course requirements:

- [ ] **Host an Event page**: anyone interested in hosting a cubing event (competition, meetup, workshop) at a venue can submit it to the platform
  - [ ] Submission form (event title, venue, city, date/time, puzzle types, description)
  - [ ] Submitted events go into a review queue (`pending` → `approved`) before appearing publicly
